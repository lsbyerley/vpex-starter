# vpex-starter
Vue, Parcel, Express starter app

This repo is a somewhat barebones starting point for buildling a web app with a front-end powered by VueJS and a backend powered by ExpressJS. For simplicities sake, the front-end javascript is bundled using ParcelJS. The complexity of an app varies from project to project. For this reason, I have not added Vuex or Vue-Router. 

## Local Development
Clone the repo to your machine and change to the directory, then..
```
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run dev
```
